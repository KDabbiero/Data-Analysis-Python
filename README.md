# Data-Analysis-Python
# Overview

The data set that I am using has the titles, ratings, release years, and descriptions of movies and TV Shows that are on Netflix for different countries. I obtained the data from this site:

https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows

I've been wanting to learn more about data analysis and I thought that this would be a good data set that interested me. I wanted to gain exposure to the libraries that I have listed below. 
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

What is the average reelease year for movies/ TV Shows on Netflix?

2013

How does the country effect the ratings of movies / TV Shows that are offered to different countries?

Not all countries are offered the same shows. Where these restrictions come from and why they are in place would require futher analysis and more data.

* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/api.html)

# Future Work

* Figure out how to put titles at the top of the graphs
* Find a larger data set that's more current
* Figure out how to do more with the duration category
